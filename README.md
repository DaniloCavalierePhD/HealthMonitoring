# HealthMonitoring
Repository for Vegetation Health Monitoring based on fuzzy inference.

The notebook performs fuzzy modeling of spectral indices and runs fuzzy inference on them to assess vegetation health state.

Areas for tests are taken from the ontology smartPA present in the repository. The ontology should be added to drive folder on colab to load areas and see results correctly.
